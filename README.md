# SlordyTech

I am a Computer Science student specializing in Game Development. I have a passion for building complex systems and constantly improving my programming skills, whether it's for games or general software engineering.

### Technical Background
My expertise lies in C++, C#, and Python. I am proficient with major engines like Unreal Engine, Unity, and Godot, but I also enjoy building things from scratch, including custom engines using DirectX.

### Projects & Experience
I have worked on numerous projects, both solo and in teams. I spend a significant portion of my free time coding and experimenting with new technologies. 

*Note: Many of my current projects and learning repositories are kept private as they are works in progress.*

### Contact Me
You can find a selection of my projects on my [Portfolio](https://nova564.github.io/Portfolio/) (please note that it does not feature everything I've built), or reach out via [Email](mailto:nassimzakri@gmail.com).
